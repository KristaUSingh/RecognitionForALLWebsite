     <h2><center>Mini History</h2></center>
    <section class = "history">
      <p> Guyana was originally a <strong>British colony</strong> until it gained its independence on <strong>May 26th, 1966</strong>. Also known as "The Land of Many Waters", Guyana was formly known as British Guinea under the British rule, and was part of the mainland - The British West Indies. The first European ever to encounter Guyana was named Sir Walter Raleigh. Its capital, <strong>Georgetown</strong>, still remains in the heart of Guyana's <strong>10 regions</strong> making history very prevalent in the country. Moreover, before decolonization after World War II, Guyana was strictly <strong>ruled by imperialists</strong> who used the tactic of <strong>divide and rule</strong>, to create conflicts amongst different ethnic groups. After decolonization, these tensions continued to rise and even still exist today in Guyana.</p>

     <h3><center>Cultural-Makeup</h3></center>
    <section class = "cultural-makeup">
      <p> Guyana is composed of 3 main religions which are <strong>Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity</strong>. However, Guyana is composed of various ethnic groups ranging from <strong>Chinese people, Indo-Guyanese, Afro-Guyanese, Amerindian people, and much more</strong>. Despite the diverse ethnic groups that exist in Guyana, <strong>Guyana remains unified</strong> at most times; even though people have their own cultural religion, they make sure to celebrate others' cultural beliefs as well. On the other hand, <strong>sometimes these beliefs may get in the way of bigger political and social issues</strong> in the country.</p>

     <h4><center> Most Recent Election </h4></center>
    <section class = "recentElection">
      <p> In Guyana's <strong>most recent election in March of 2020</strong>, a voting ballot rise up occured, which <strong>delayed the election for 5 months</strong>. Only in <strong>August 2020 was there a final jurisdiction</strong>. It appeared that two parties, <strong>A Partnership for National Unity (APNU)</strong> and <strong>People Progressive Party/Civic (PPP)</strong>, were fighting to win the people of Guyana's vote, but really an <strong>ongoing ethnic conflict</strong> was taking place. The <strong>Afro-Guyanese group supported APNU</strong>, while the <strong>Indo-Guyanese group supported PPP</strong>. With APNU's prior ruling, PPP was bound to win, but the Afro-Guyanese attempted to <strong>rig the election by taking away some of the ballots towards PPP officials</strong>. This uprise in tension caused many protests and frustration amongst the people of Guyana as they patiently waited for a fair, and elective result to be declared. However, after the involvement of the Highcourt, it was finally declared that the <strong>PPP party won the election</strong> in August 2020 with <strong>Irfaan Ali, the new President of Guyana</strong>.</p>

     <h5><center>Oil Issue In Guyana</h5></center>
    <section class = "oilIssue"> 
      <p> Guyana is known to contain <strong>large amounts of oil</strong> for the tiny country it is. The company <strong>Exxon Mobile</strong> is trying to help the country use this oil for profit, therefore <strong>boosting their economy and reputation</strong>. Yet <strong>politics and border disputes have stood in the way</strong> of Guyana achieving this goal. Guyana's bordering neighbor, <strong>Venezeula,owns about 40% of Guyana's territory</strong> making it difficult to use the land to gain wealth without controversy. Even though tribes from Venezuela has settled in the 40% land dispute as being claimed as Guyana, these <strong>new oil discoveries caused Venezuela to challenge Guyana</strong> for the land they originally owned. This conflict played a huge role in <strong>politicians questioning Exxon Mobile's production agreement</strong> with Guyana's government. With this question in place, <strong>Exxon Mobile withdrew from the agreement</strong> to recover their expenses before splitting it 50% with the Guyanese government. Now, though there is oil in Guyana, they <strong>do not have the resources</strong> to make a profit from it, since mining oil is such a large scale energy production.</p>

     <h6><center>Prince Harry Visits Guyana</h6></center>
    <section class = "princeHarry">
      <p> As Guyana celebrated its <strong>50th year of independence</strong>, suprinsingly <strong>Prince Harry</strong>, one of the royal members from the United Kingdom, visited the country in 2016. Now, as the prince is a very popular, and prominent figure in most places across the world, <strong>many seemed to not care that he visited a place like Guyana</strong>. Even <strong>news medias</strong> across the world <strong>did not</strong> broadcasted the prince's visit to this developing country. This is very apparent in the twitter post that is displayed next to this section, as it received very few likes and comments. Nevertheless, Prince Harry even visited the headquarters of Guyana's Defense Force, but <strong>no recognition was gained for this special visit</strong> that was very important to the people of Guyana. <strong>News medias must be more involved in the events</strong> happening in Guyana, as they are important: history is being made there. Yet, even when a very prominent figure in society was there to celebrate this <strong>great momentum in Guyana's history</strong>, such news was not shared with the world.</p>

     <h5 class = "h7"><center>Guyana & Venezuela's Border Dispute</h5></center>
    <section class = "guyanaVenezuela">
      <p> <strong>Guyana, and its bordering neighbor, Venezuela</strong>, have been in territorial disputes since 1899. With that being said, in 1899 an international tribunal awarded Guyana that made an <strong>offical border between both of the South American countries</strong>; the borders mainly favored Guyana which at the time was a British colony. The <strong>jungle west of the Essequibo River in Guyana was filled with natural resources such as gold, diamonds, and timber</strong> making the dispute even more huge than it already was as Venezuela also wanted these resources. On the contrary, Venezuela <strong>counteracts Guyana's claims with a 1966 agreement</strong> that apparently resolves the original 1899 arbitration. With these conflicts underway, in December 2020, the <strong>United Nations' highest standing court, the World Court, tried to intervene to resolve this issue amongst the two nations</strong>. However, the case has now moved to the status of where the merits would be judged by the international court, so there could be<strong> months or even years before a decision is made</strong>.</p>
